## Abstract
Agriculture is the feeding source to every human being on this planet. And Indian economy highly depends on agriculture resources. So, productivity of agriculture resources is must. Due to certain factors the productivity decreases and it can be controlled by detecting the leaf disease at the right time. 
Apple leaf disease is the foremost factor that restricts apple yield and quality. Usually, much time is taken for disease detection with the existing diagnostic techniques; therefore, farmers frequently miss the best time for preventing and treating diseases. The detection of apple leaf diseases is a significant research problem, and its main aim is to discover an efficient technique for disease leaf image diagnosis. This article has made an effort to propose a method that can detect the disease of apple plant leaf using deep neural network (DNN). Plant diseases detection system (PDDS) architecture is designed. Speeded up robust feature (SURF) is used for feature extraction, which helps to achieve better detection and classification accuracy. Classification parameters, such as Precision, Recall, F-measure, Error, and Accuracy is computed, and a comparative analysis has been performed to depict the effectiveness of the proposed work. 

## Introduction
The detection of Apple plant leaf disease is the vital process as plants leaf consists of multiple disease regions. The shape of each disease in the leaves varies, having uneven colour and fuzzy texture. There are many different ways to detect the leaf disease through soft-computing based approaches, image pre-processing, automatic detection. The general diseases are in the form of spots, which are yellow and brown. Alternatively, Segmentation based approaches helps in recognising the leaf disease and it separates the leaf from the background. The different types of image processing techniques are applied to process those images, to get different and useful features needed for the purpose of analyzing the disease.

## Problem Definition
To detect the different types of Apple Leaf Disease using Deep Learning Techniques and Algorithms.

## Conclusion
experimental analysis is done to detect and classify the diseases from apple plant leaf images in an effective way using the concept of CNN as a convolutional neural network approach.
The proposed PDDS has been carried out in different steps before applying the DNN such as image enhancement and segmentation in pre-processing phase, feature extraction using SURF descriptor and at the last training and classification using the DNN. By using all these processes, the accuracy of the proposed PDDS for apple leaf has improved. From the experiments, it is concluded that the accuracy of the proposed model with SURF 
In the near future, we will investigate and evaluate our methodology in other practical environments with many infected leaves of several plants and try to apply the different ways to detect the apple leaf disease.
